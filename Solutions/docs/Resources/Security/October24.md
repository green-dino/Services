# Information Gathering and Security Testing
Goals
* Equip participants with the knowledge and skills to conduct comprehensive security testing on web applications and infrastructure.
* Enable participants to identify and mitigate common vulnerabilities through hands-on exercises.
Outcomes
* Participants will understand how to effectively gather information on web servers, applications, and underlying technologies.
* Participants will be able to recognize and address security weaknesses in web applications related to configuration, authentication, authorization, and input/output validation.
* Participants will develop the ability to test and secure web applications against common attacks like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and others.
Objectives
## 1. Information Gathering
    * Learn how to fingerprint technologies and web servers.
    * Understand techniques for discovering application frameworks and potential information leakage.
    * Practice using search engines and reviewing metadata to uncover hidden data.
## 2. Configuration and Deployment Management
    * Explore methods for enumerating admin interfaces and assessing network configurations.
    * Identify hidden resources and evaluate HTTP security headers.
## 3. Identity Management and Authentication
    * Test for secure authentication mechanisms and identify weaknesses in password policies, account management, and session handling.
    * Explore methods for bypassing authentication and mitigating brute force attacks.
## 4. Authorization and Boundary Testing
    * Assess user access controls and test for privilege escalation.
    * Evaluate the security of file inclusions, cross-origin resource sharing, and protection against CSRF.
## 5. Cookie and Session Management
    * Analyze session management practices, including session fixation, timeout, and cookie attributes.
    * Test logout functionality and secure session variables.
## 6. Accessibility and Input/Output Validation
    * Examine web applications for vulnerabilities related to denial of service and cross-site scripting (XSS).
    * Test for injection flaws, including SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, and others.
## 7. Testing for Weak Cryptography
    * Identify weak SSL/TLS ciphers and test for insufficient transport layer protection.
    * Assess the risk of sensitive information being transmitted via unencrypted channels.
## 8. Workflow/Dataflow Tests
    * Validate business logic, integrity checks, and defenses against misuse of applications.
    * Explore techniques for circumventing workflows and testing the resilience of business processes.
